# apollo-soybase

An attempt to use Apollo GraphQL server and client to query the soybase mysql database.

Right now the server and client are connected via `.env` vars that are not stored in the repo (because we're not supposed to).
You can create your own using the "Monolith" option in Apollo Studio (which is no longer the default!).

## server

## client
