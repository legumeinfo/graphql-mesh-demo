# GraphQL Server Prototype
This repository contains a prototype GraphQL server made with the [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server) that consumes data from one or more InterMine servers.

## Setup
Use the following command to install server's dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

## Running
Once the dependencies are installed, use the following command to start the server:
```
$ node src/index.js
```
Then navigate your browser to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to query the server with the [Apollo Explorer](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/explorer/).
